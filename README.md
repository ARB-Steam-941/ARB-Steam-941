Introduction

&ARB Steam-941 protocol inherits and expands the ERC-721 and ERC-20 protocols, integrates the ERC-404 and DN-404 protocols to innovate the framework architecture, and implements it following the new steam-941 protocol.

ARB Steam-941 protocol has relatively native liquidity, fragmentation and aggregation characteristics. It makes a mixed and balanced formulation of multiple protocol standards, and completes the trade-off between the state and the protocol through the relatively optimal solution, which will be in the steam-941 stable state.Arb steam-941 effectively isolates the possible lossy import paths of ERC404, ERC721 and ERC20 protocol standards under the premise of stable state. The isolation protection is completed through the lossy encoding protocol. The token data and tokenid will occupy the corresponding protocol space.
